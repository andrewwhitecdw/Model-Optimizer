"""Per-model descriptor classes.

``ModelSpec`` is the one global descriptor of a model: everything modelopt knows
about a model type lives on a single instance, resolved by ``config.model_type``.
It is composed from section mixins so each concern stays a small, separate class:

- **topic sections** hold architecture facts shared across subsystems (``MoESpec``:
  what a model's MoE blocks are);
- **subsystem sections** hold one subsystem's per-model data (``ExportSpec``).

Sections hold per-model data plus trivial accessors over that data; subsystem logic
never lives here. A model registers exactly one ``ModelSpec`` in its sibling module,
filling only the sections it customizes.
